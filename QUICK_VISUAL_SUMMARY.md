# 📸 Image Description Integration - Visual Summary

## 🎯 What We Changed

### **BEFORE:** Separate Storage ❌
```
PDF Processing:
  Text → Markdown → Chunks → ChromaDB (text chunks)
  Images → Descriptions → ChromaDB (image chunks)
                                 ↓
                        STORED SEPARATELY!

Problem: Searching might miss context
```

### **AFTER:** Combined Storage ✅
```
PDF Processing:
  Text → Markdown ─┐
                   ├─→ MERGE → Enriched Pages → Chunks → ChromaDB
  Images → Descriptions ─┘
                                                    ↓
                                    TEXT + IMAGES TOGETHER!

Benefit: Complete context in every chunk
```

## 📄 Example: Page 3 of Attention Paper

### **Original Markdown (Before)**
```markdown
## Page 3

Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using 
stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected 
layers for both the encoder and decoder.
```

### **Enriched Markdown (After)** ✨
```markdown
## Page 3

Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using 
stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected 
layers for both the encoder and decoder.

**[IMAGES ON THIS PAGE]:**

- **Image: 1706.03762v7_page_3_img_1.png**
  A detailed architectural diagram of the Transformer model. 
  The diagram shows the encoder-decoder structure with 
  multi-head attention layers, feed-forward networks, and 
  residual connections. Input and output embeddings are 
  shown at the bottom and top respectively.
